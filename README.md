# Deep Learning Based Music Recognizer

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning approach for music recognition. The goal is to create a system that can accurately identify songs or music tracks based on their audio features. The project is in its initial stages and currently explores various deep learning models, including ResNet50, LSTM, and CNN with n-fold cross-validation.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-recognizer.git

## Usage

The project contains Jupyter notebooks with initial implementations of the models:

- `basic_CNN.ipynb`: A basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach.
- `LSTM.ipynb`: An implementation using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- `resnet50.ipynb`: An implementation using the ResNet50 model.

To run the notebooks, open them in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.
